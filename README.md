## General context
This workshop dives into Neuropixels recordings, a powerful technique for capturing neural activity from freely moving animals over extended periods. Researchers of all experience levels will learn the entire workflow, from Neuropixels technology basics to data analysis, gaining expertise from leading experts in the field. By attending, you can expand your research capabilities to study complex behaviors and track brain disorders in a more natural setting, while joining a collaborative community to accelerate your discoveries.

## Target audience

*About ELIXIR Training Platform*

The ELIXIR Training Platform was established to develop a training community that spans all ELIXIR member states (see the list of Training Coordinators). It aims to strengthen national training programmes, grow bioinformatics training capacity and competence across Europe, and empower researchers to use ELIXIR's services and tools.

One service offered by the Training Platform is TeSS, the training registry for the ELIXIR community. Together with ELIXIR France and ELIXIR Slovenia, VIB as lead node for ELIXIR Belgium is engaged in consolidating quality and impact of the TeSS training resources (2022-23) (https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/2022-trp3).

The Training eSupport System was developed to help trainees, trainers and their institutions to have a one-stop shop where they can share and find information about training and events, including training material. This way we can create a catalogue that can be shared within the community. How it works is what we are going to find out in this course.

*About VIB and VIB Technologies*

VIB is an entrepreneurial non-profit research institute, with a clear focus on groundbreaking strategic basic research in life sciences and operates in close partnership with the five universities in Flanders â€“ Ghent University, KU Leuven, University of Antwerp, Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Hasselt University.

As part of the VIB Technologies, the 12 VIB Core Facilities, provide support in a wide array of research fields and housing specialized scientific equipment for each discipline. Science and technology go hand in hand. New technologies advance science and often accelerate breakthroughs in scientific research. VIB has a visionary approach to science and technology, founded on its ability to identify and foster new innovations in life sciences.

The goal of VIB Technology Training is to up-skill life scientists to excel in the domains of VIB Technologies, Bioinformatics & AI, Software Development, and Research Data Management.
